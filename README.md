This a static page made with ReactJS to learn some concepts about it.

The concepts I learned:

- Components
- Props
- States
- JSX
- Components lifecycle
- Immutability

I also had contact with some important technologies to make React apps possible, like Babel and Webpack. That way I could kinda understand how it works.
